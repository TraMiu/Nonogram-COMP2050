# Nonogram-COMP2050
A team project for the Artificial Intelligence Course in VinUniversity. Run picross.py to play the game and testing with puzzles.
This project interface was extended from this open-source project - https://github.com/orsonhart/pycross?fbclid=IwAR3M1SjqGZmGvb5LDUjTCdIodCfF_UG-ux6Dlbv3fBUZdOXZUiYpv_27vsc
We have modified the interface and implemented various solvers in addition to the original baseline solver.
